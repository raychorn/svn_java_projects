<h2>Client Side Image Map Authoring</h2><p>
<p>A system has been written to allow users to edit the 'hot spots'
on an image without leaving their Web browser.
This system is written in <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/">JAVA</a>, and requires a Web browser which
supports the JAVA programming extensions. These browsers are to date
Netscape 2.0b4 and 2.0b5. The system may work with other browers, but
has not been tested.
</p>
<p> 
The system is in an early stage of development, and has the following
known problems : 
<ol>
<li>Hot spot areas seem to be a bit misplaced - only about half the 
area works properly. This now seems to be a bug in Netscape 2.0b4.
<li>There is no way to save or load the resultant map yet - this is being
worked on.
<li>The applet does not clean up properly after itself
<li>Netscape 2.0b5 sometimes seems to crash on this applet.
</ol>
</p>
<p>Please note that this system is ALPHA development, and is <B>unsupported</B>. It is released in the hope that it might be useful, and does not have any warranty at all.</p>
<p>The following other information is available :</p>

<li><a href="source.htm">Source code of the system ( BETA 2 API)</a>
</UL>
<p>We welcome all comments regarding this system, as it is still 
in an early stage of development.</p>
