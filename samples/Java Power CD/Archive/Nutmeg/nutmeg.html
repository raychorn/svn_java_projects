<H3>THOUGHT Inc. Announces Nutmeg<FONT SIZE=-3>(TM)</FONT>, One of the first commercial class libraries available for the Java Language.</H3>
<P>Even though it is one of the most promising new techologies to arrive, Java programming can
still require a great deal of time for low level programming tasks.  One of the areas where this is
true is in the area of list management, which is still fairly primitive in the Java Class libraries.
Smalltalk has long been known as a powerful programming language for applications like list
management.  THOUGHT Inc. has sought to address this problem of making Java useful for low
level programming tasks by creating a set of Java Classes entitled Nutmeg. We
modeled the classes after the Smalltalk Collection Class library because of
it's combination of power and elegance.  With these classes, Nutmeg for Java is 
truly an indispensible tool to assist programmers in developing advanced 
applications using Java in a more timely and reliable manner.

<P>Nutmeg features include classes to manage Arrays of information, Indexed Collections, Ordered
and Sorted Collections, Sets and even Dictionaries.  Users can also define a Smalltalk style or
Java style error handling (The java style uses exception handling features built into the
language) as well as programmer defined sorting criteria and in many areas programmer defined
Error handling and Object Selection and User Defined Execution blocks.  
These more robust classes should greatly increase
the useability of Java for doing large scale and serious development using Java,
and at the same time provide a simple and more powerful interface for even
basic list management tasks.

<P>An evaluation copy of the FCS (production) version of Nutmeg is currently 
available for download from our products section at
<A HREF="http://www.thoughtinc.com">"http://www.thoughtinc.com".</A>  If you are an student programer we have a $49 version
available.  This 49$ version is a binary license only and will not guarantee immediate response
to support questions, although general internet based support will still be available to report bugs.
Corporate pricing is expected to be $495 per seat for the binary release, $995 per seat for a
source code license.  Both zip and tar files (for windows and unix) are available for general
download from the URL.  These classes have been designed to work with either the Windows or
Unix based Java Developers Kits (aka. Java FCS1.0 API).  Applications written with Nutmeg should
run with any Beta runtime environment, such as Netscape 2.0 Browsers which have Java
enabled, or the Java Developer's Kit runtime.
