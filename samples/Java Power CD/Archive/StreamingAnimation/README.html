<H3>What is it?</H3>

<P>
The Streaming Animation Player from Dimension X is a set of Java(tm)
classes which enable you to put animations on your web pages.
These animations display as they download. 
<H3>What does it play?</H3>

<P>
Currently the Streaming animation applet supports the FLIC file
format (both FLI and FLC), and will support a format which allows
for better compression, and shorter download times.</P>

<P> Right now you can use any standard FLIC encoder
<A HREF="http://povray.cdrom.com/pov-cdrom/cd/programs/povutil/dfv_dta/index.html">
Dave's TARGA Animator</A> works well or you can purchase Animator Pro
from <A HREF="http://www.autodesk.com">Autodesk</A> which will also
export FLIC files.</P>

<H3>How do I use it?</H3>

<OL>
<LI>Download either the zip file or tar file from Dimension X.
<LI>Uncompress the file in a directory of your choice. A good
choice would be the directory in which you plan to put the page
containing your animation, though this is not required.
<LI>The directory in which you uncompressed the file you downloaded
will now contain a dnx directory which contains the class files
needed to use the Streaming Animation Player. 
</OL>

<UL>
<LI>Now just put the APPLET tag in your document.
</UL>

<H3>The APPLET Tag and you</H3>

<P>
This is the tag used to show the animation at the top of the page:
<!-- if you want to copy the APPLET tag it appears in usable form at the top of this page-->

<PRE>
&lt;APPLET CODE=&quot;dnx.StrAnimItem.class&quot; CODEBASE=&quot;./&quot; WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=220&gt;
&lt;PARAM NAME=&quot;stranim&quot; VALUE=&quot;my_animation.flc&quot;&gt;
&lt;PARAM NAME=&quot;dither&quot; VALUE=&quot;better&quot;&gt;
&lt;/APPLET&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
The HEIGHT and WIDTH arguments to the Streaming Animation Applet
tell the applet at what size the applet should display your animation.
However, these values do not have to be the actual dimensions
of the animation that you are playing. Scaling of the animation
will not occur, though, if only one of the HEIGHT and WIDTH arguments
differs from that defined in the animation file itself. The parameters
that you can pass to the Streaming Animation Player include &quot;stranim&quot;,
and &quot;dither.&quot; Stranim gives the path to, and name of
the animation which you wish to play. Dither allows you to select
the method that will be used to dither the animation. The accepted
values for dither are &quot;better&quot;(the default) and &quot;faster.&quot;
Faster dithering is (Surprise!) slightly faster than better dithering.
However, some animations will not look as good when dithered faster.
<P>
For more information about the APPLET tag try the 
<A HREF="http://www.sandia.gov/sci_compute/elements#APPLET">HTML Reference Manual</A>

<H3>Details</H3>

<P>
You must access pages containing streaming animtions through a
Web server. That is, using Open File in your browser to view your
page will not allow you to view the Streaming animations on your
page.

<P>
If there is more than one Streaming Animation on a page they will
download in sequence.

<H3>The Future</H3>

<P> Better compression and an encoder are on the way. For a licensing
fee of $195.00(US) you will get updates to the current version of the
decoder, e-mail support, and the encoder, when it is available.
