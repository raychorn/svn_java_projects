<H3>THOUGHT Inc. Announces CinnaMoney<FONT SIZE=-3>(TM)</FONT>, making the Java
language suitable for financial and engineering calculations.</H3>
<P>Accurate financial and engineering calculations with the base Java
Developer's Kit has not been possible.  With CinnaMoney this is
now possible.  For example a financial institution doing calculations
over the internet using Java can now keep track of and display trillions of
yen or fractions of pennies accurately.  Engineers might use hundreds of
machines on the internet running CinnaMoney based programs to calculate
weather forecast maps, or to assist in accurately mapping the stars.  The uses have
enormous implications due to the explosive use of the internet as a way to
share computing resources.
<P>Some of the technical benefits of this easy to us advanced class are:
<pre>
1) Cinnamoney has arbitrary precision to handle complex financial calculations.

2) The programmer can easily convert native Java data types (such as String,
float, int and long) into CinnaMoney Objects with its built in conversion 
routines.

3) This class integrates with the <A HREF="http://www.thoughtinc.com">THOUGHT Inc</A>. <A HREF="http://www.thoughtinc.com/nutmeg">Nutmeg Classes</A> for sorting and 
manipulation of CinnaMoney values.

4) The programmer can determine the precision of calculationg and printing the
results.

5) The precision can be redefined on the fly.

</PRE>
<P>An evaluation copy of the FCS 1.0 version of CinnaMoney is currently 
available for download from our products section at
<A HREF="http://www.thoughtinc.com">"http://www.thoughtinc.com".</A>  
If you are a student or non-commercial programer we have a $49 version
available.  This 49$ version is a binary license only and will not guarantee immediate response
to support questions, although general internet based support will still be available to report bugs.
Corporate/Commercial pricing is expected to be $795 per seat for the binary release, $1495 per seat for a
source code license.  Both zip and tar files (for windows and unix) are available for general
download from the URL.  This class has been designed to work with ANY platform 
as long as they java the Java Developers Kits (aka. Java FCS1.0 API).  
Applications written with CinnaMoney should run with any FCS 1.0 runtime
environment, such as Netscape 2.0 Browsers which have been Java enabled, or
the Java Developer's Kit runtime.
