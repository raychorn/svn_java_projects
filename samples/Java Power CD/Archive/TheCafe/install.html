<h1>Dimension X Cafe:  Installation Guide</h1>
<p>This is a guide for installing <b>The Cafe</b> on your own
server so that you
can use it in your own web pages.  Please not that no special installation
is necessary to use <b>The Cafe</b> - all that is required is a java aware
browser.  This installation guide is only for those people who want to put
<b>The Cafe</b> on their own web pages.

<h2>System Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>You obviously need to be running an http server
<li>You also need to be running an IRC server on <b>the same host</b> as your
http server if you want <b>The Cafe</b> to work under Netscape 2.0.  The
reason for this is that Netscape does not allow applets to open sockets to
any machine other than the one that they were downloaded from.  The JDK
appletviewer <i>does</i> allow applets to open connections to different
machines (if you configure your security options) and HotJava beta probably
will too, so <b>The Cafe</b> could still be of some use even if your IRC server
is not the same as your http server, but in order for <b>The Cafe</b> to
work in Netscape, your http server and IRC server need to be the same
machine.
<p>An IRC server does not currently come with <b>The Cafe</b>, but
<b>The Cafe</b> will work with any standard IRC server.  We are looking
into creating our own chat server, but for now we recommend that you 
download and install an IRC server from
<a href=http://www.prospero.com/globalstage/servers.html>Prospero</a>.

</ul>

<h2>Downloading and Unpacking</h2>
<p>First <a href=http://www.dnx.com/chat/download-agree.html>download</a>
the current version of <b>The Cafe</b> in either zip or tar format.
Unpack the downloaded file in the directory that you want <b>The Cafe</b>
to reside in.  Now you need to create an html file that references <b>The
Cafe</b>.  An explanation of what to include in the html file, along with
example html, can be found in the <a href=docs.html>beta-tester's
documentation</a>.

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
We need your help to make this installation guide more comprehensive.
