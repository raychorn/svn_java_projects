<h2>Licensing Information</h2>

<P><STRONG>The Cafe</STRONG> can currently be 
<A HREF="download-agree.html">downloaded here</A>, for free use by beta
testers.  Once downloaded, use <a href="install.html">the installation
guide</a> to help step you through putting <b>The Cafe</b> on your
own web site.</P>

<P><STRONG>The Cafe</STRONG> is available to be licensed at $195.00,
for as many sites as you wish.  For a licensing fee of $295.00 you can
have a version of the Cafe without the Dimension X logo or with the
logo of your choice.  Contact Brad Karns 
<A HREF="mailto:bk@dimensionx.com">&lt;bk@dimensionx.com&gt;</A> at (213)
957.0300 to purchase a license.

<h2>Putting <b>The Cafe</b> in an web page</h2>
<h3>Frames</h3>
<b>The Cafe</b> can be used to send the browser to different URL's.  Whenever
somebody types in an URL, it is highlighted in the display window and clicking
on the URL will send the browser to that URL.  There are also some options
in the control menu that send the browser to a different URL.  The frame
that is sent to a different URL is currently called "Intro".  This will
be made configurable in the next release of <b>The Cafe</b>.

<a name=example_html><h3>Putting <b>The Cafe</b> in an HTML File</h3></a>
<p>To put <b>The Cafe</b> in an html file, use the
<a href="#params">parameters</a> listed below to configure <b>The Cafe</b>.
An example of what needs to be inserted into an html file is:

<p>
<code>
&lt;applet codebase=. code=Talk.class width=525 height=180&gt;<br>
&lt;param name=server value=www.dnx.com&gt;<br>
&lt;param name=channel value=#dnxtalk&gt;<br>
&lt;param name="enter_sound" value="doorbell.au"&gt;<br>
&lt;param name="private_sound" value="door.au"&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;STRONG&gt;The Cafe&lt;/STRONG&gt; requires a java enabled browser to run.
This means that it will &lt;STRONG&gt;not&lt;/STRONG&gt; run on the current
version of Netscape for Macintosh, Windows 3.1, or the 16 bit Windows
95 version.  The fact that you can see this message means that you are
probably not using a browser that can understand the java beta API.<br>
<br>
&lt;/applet&gt;<br>

</code>

<a name=params><h2>Applet Parameters</h2></a>

<P>The following parameters can be passed to <STRONG>The Cafe</STRONG>
using the standard method of passing parameters to applets as
<a href="#example_html">illustrated above</a>.</P>

<ul>

<li><STRONG>server - </STRONG> Specifies the server to be used as the
IRC server.  Please note that Netscape's current restrictions on
sockets dictate that a java applet can only open connections to the
server they were downloaded from.  Consequently, for <STRONG>The
Cafe</STRONG> to work with Netscape, you should install your IRC
server on the same host as your http server, but on port 6667 (the
standard IRC port).

<li><STRONG>channel - </STRONG> Specifies the IRC channel that
<STRONG>The Cafe</STRONG> will connect to.

<li><STRONG>chanac - </STRONG> If the IRC server you are running
requires a password to create channels (as the Prospero server does),
use the chanac parameter to specify the password.

<li><STRONG>cafe_name - </STRONG> If the user chooses the "Lift Cafe
Out of Browser" option, <STRONG>The Cafe</STRONG> will be placed in an
external window and the title of the window is specified by
<EM>cafe_name</EM>.

<li><STRONG>enter_sound <EM>(optional)</EM> - </STRONG> The sound
specified will be played every time someone new enters <STRONG>The
Cafe</STRONG>.  All sounds should be in au format.

<li><STRONG>private_sound <EM>(optional)</EM> - </STRONG> The sound
specified will be played every time the user receives a private
message.  All sounds should be in au format.  

</UL>
