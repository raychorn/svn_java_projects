=============================================================


These are the last minute release notes for Liquid Motion
(formerly title TEA or JACK).

Please read the readme.txt and the enclosed user documentation
(provided as an HTML document).

Two things to remember if you encounter problems with
Liquid Motion:

1)  This is a special version of the editor and the player.
    We will make this version a very usable tool, but all
    significant enhancements will be in the pro versions.

2)  This is a BETA version.
    We are continuing to work on certain areas, and are
    releasing this to make the tool available, and to 
    get feedback from you.

We very much value your feedback.

Please mail your comments to tea@dimensionx.com.

==========================
KNOWN BUGS/ Problem areas

The PlayerApplet currently loads all media before it
begins to play, instead of streaming. This will be addressed 
in a later version.

The UI (menus, etc.) is currently optimized for 
the Windows environment.  On other platforms you will,
e.g. see the little ampersands cluttering up the menu names.

The HTML help doc is incomplete - it is currently in rework.

In the Liquid Motion Editor, the player buttons and the scene 
player window may occasionally be drawn incorrectly (they may 
be shifted, or may not be visible).  This is due to certain
bugs in the standard 1.0 Java distribution from Sun.

We have addressed these problems in the professional versions 
of Liquid Motion, but we cannot legally include the modified 
Java libraries. We expect that Sun will address these issues
soon as well.

Note that the problems we describe do not affect applet 
playback of Liquid Motion Scenes.
