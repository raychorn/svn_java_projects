<p><b>Liquid Motion</b> provides tools to integrate animation
sequences and audio into a Scene, which can be easily embedded as an applet
into a web browser window. The program will play a single frame sequence
in a window, but also provides a rich environment for dynamic animation.
</p>

<p><b>Liquid Motion</b> is based upon a model of <i>objects</i> which can be manipulated
directly by the artist, in the Scene context. The <b>Liquid Motion</b> program
allows you to easily create and edit Scenes in one primary window using
image and audio resources (e.g., .<i>gif, .au </i>files). </p>

<p>This User's Guide is designed to walk you through each of the fun and
easy-to-use features of <b>Liquid Motion</b>. To view examples of animation
Scenes and obtain detailed information on the professional version of the
program, <b>Liquid Motion Pro</b>, click on the links. </p>

<p>It should also be noted that, as an authoring environment, <b>Liquid Motion</b>
is programmed in the new Java package, <i>JACK</i> which supports sub-classing
for new types of animation elements, new behaviors, etc. JACK is a <i>scripting
language</i> and therefore provides an actual editable file for programmers.
Documentation for this procedure is available from Dimension X.</p>

<h1><b><font SIZE=+3>C</font><font SIZE=+2>reating a New Scene</font></b></h1>

<p>When <b>Liquid Motion</b> initially loads, the <b>Root Scene Properties</b> dialog
appears, allowing you to name a new Scene. This name will now appear as
the screen header. If you then use <b>S</b>ave or Save <b>A</b>s to designate
the directory in which the Scene file is to be saved, upon adding the first
sequence to the Scene, <b>Liquid Motion</b> will automatically create the subdirectories:
\<b>images</b> and <b>\audio</b> and will copy each added sequence file
(image or sound) to the appropriate &quot;project directory&quot;. This
provides you with a few simplified locations for collecting all the elements
of your animation project. (Note that in order for <b>Liquid Motion</b> to direct
media files to these project directories, you must save the Scene to a
designated directory <i>before</i> adding sequences to the Scene.) For
more details on saving a Scene, see the end of this documentation.</p>

<p>If you wish to open and edit an existing Scene file, you can simply
close the <b>Root Scene Properties</b> dialog and access the file by selecting:
<b>F</b>ile =&gt; <b>O</b>pen.</p>

<ul        type=square>
<li><b><font SIZE=+2>A</font><font SIZE=+1>dding an Image Sequence</font></b></li>
</ul>

<ul            type=square>
<p>When creating a Scene in <b>Liquid Motion</b>, you can add an image sequence such
as a <i>.gif </i>or .<i>jpeg </i>file which may contain a single image,
a series of images, or a single image that includes the entire sequence,
joined vertically into a strip. (You will also be able to use a horizontal
strip image in an upcoming beta version of <b>Liquid Motion</b>.) </p>

<p><b>Liquid Motion Pro </b>provides a Content Manager screen for managing these
resource files (including a Search feature with which you can search for
a file by name or based upon comments assigned to a sequence by an artist).
The professional version also allows you to add entire Scenes, previously
constructed in <b>Liquid Motion</b>, to nest within the Scene you are currently creating.
And you can apply motion and time behaviors to the entire Scene rather
than just to individual sequences.</p>

<p>If you want the animation sequence(s) to appear on a specified background,
you must add the background as the <i>first </i>image in the Scene, then
all additional images added will appear on top of that background. </p>

<h4><b><font SIZE=+1>A</font>dding a Background Image</b></h4>

<ul                   type=square>
<p><b><i>To add an image</i></b>, select: <b>E</b>dit =&gt; <b>A</b>dd
Image.</p>

<p>In the <b>Add Image Element</b> dialog, the <b><i>Browse</i></b> button
allows you to access the <b>Open Image File </b>dialog which displays your
image files, sorted by name, size, type or date modified. Once you select
a file, the filename will appear in the Add Image Element dialog in the
Filename Pattern field. You will note this dialog allows you to designate
whether the image file should originate from its source URL, or if you
want it copied to your &quot;project directory&quot; (e.g., <i>\java\pix\images</i>).
This feature is especially helpful when later exporting the Scene for use
in a web browser, allowing you to find all sequence files related to the
Scene conveniently located in one place. </p>

<p>If the selected image is to serve as a background for the Scene, you
can accept the sequence and frame defaults, and click on <b>OK</b>. The
image will now appear on the screen, in a selected or &quot;highlighted&quot;
mode, indicating it is active for editing. To view the image normally,
click on the background border or press <b>ESC</b>.</p>

<p><i><b>To change the color for highlighted images</b>,</i> select: <b>V</b>iew
=&gt; <b>H</b>ighlight Color.</p>

<p><b><i>To change the background border color</i></b>, select: <b>V</b>iew
=&gt; <b>B</b>order Color.</p>

<p>(Adjusting the background border color can be especially helpful when
considering how the Scene will appear in a web browser.)</p>

<p>It is best to lock the background image into place to avoid moving it
by accident. To select the image, click on it. Then, select: <b>E</b>dit
=&gt; <b>P</b>roperties. In the <b>Sequence Properties</b> dialog, select:
<b>Position Locked</b>. A checkmark will indicate the feature is enabled.
Then, select <b>OK</b>.</p>
</ul>

<h4><b><font SIZE=+1>A</font>dding an Image Sequence to be Animated</b></h4>

<ul                   type=square>
<p>You can select the image file in the same manner as above. Then, in
the <b>Add Image Element</b> dialog, as appropriate, select <i>Single Image</i>
or <i>Sequence</i>. If a sequence, enter the number of frames and the fps
rate. The <b>Images in:</b> field allows you to designate whether the sequence
is in <i>Separate Files</i>, a <i>Vertical Strip</i>, or <i>Horizontal
Strip</i>. To accept selections, click on <b>OK</b>. You can reset the
properties, (e.g., <i>fps rate</i>), at any time by selecting the image,
then, select: <b>E</b>dit =&gt; <b>P</b>roperties to access the <b>Sequence
Properties</b> dialog.</p>

<p>The image element will now appear (highlighted) in the upper left corner
of the Scene. To move the highlighted image to any point within the Scene,
click-and-drag it. 
<br>(<i>Note</i>: An element must first be selected (highlighted) in order
to be moved and/or edited. To deselect an element, click on the background
border or press <b>ESC</b>.) You can add as many images to the Scene as
you want. </p>
</ul>

<li><b><font SIZE=+2>A</font><font SIZE=+1>dding an Audio Sequence</font></b></li>


<p>You can add audio sequences to enhance the Scene. In the current version
of Java, these must be <b>.<i>au</i> </b>files. Adding an audio sequence
to a Scene functions much the same as with adding an image. Select: <b>E</b>dit
=&gt; Add <b>A</b>udio to access the <b>Add Audio Element</b> dialog and
then select your audio sequence. In the current beta version of <b>Liquid Motion</b>,
audio sequences will be saved in the Scene, but the <i>playback
</i>is not yet supported. This feature will be provided in an upcoming
beta version.</p>

<li><b><font SIZE=+2>D</font><font SIZE=+1>eleting an Image</font></b></li>

<p>You can delete an image from the Scene by highlighting it, then select:
<b>E</b>dit =&gt; <b>D</b>elete. Once you click on the background border,
the element will disappear from the Scene.</p>

<li><b><font SIZE=+2>P</font><font SIZE=+1>laying an Image or Audio Sequence</font></b></li>

<h4><b><font SIZE=+1>P</font>laying an Image Sequence</b></h4>

<ul                   type=square>
<p>At the bottom of the <b>Liquid Motion</b>screen, a toolbar of <i>play</i> buttons
allows you to play the Scene in various modes, such as forward, reverse,
and frame by frame. The play button options apply to the entire Scene and
each element sequence will play according to its properties and behaviors.</p>

<h4><b>The Play Button Toolbar</b></h4>

</ul>
</ul>

<li><b><font SIZE=+2>O</font><font SIZE=+1>ther Edit Menu Options</font></b></li>

<p>You will note the <b>E</b>dit menu contains several disabled options:
<i>Add Text</i> and <i>Add Render</i> (Color Blend or Tiled Image). These
features are provided in the professional version of the program, <b>Liquid Motion Pro</b>, 
and allow you to further enhance the Scene with additional creative
elements.</p>
</ul>

<h1><b><font SIZE=+3>E</font><font SIZE=+2>diting a Scene</font></b></h1>

<p>Once you have added an image or audio element to a Scene in <b>Liquid Motion</b>,
you can edit its properties and add behaviors such as a Drawn Path motion
and time-scaling. In the full version of the program, <b>Liquid Motion Pro</b>, you
can apply more sophisticated attributes such as frame sequencing and numerous
motion behaviors for moving the sequence within the Scene.</p>

<ul         type=square>
<li><b><font SIZE=+2>E</font><font SIZE=+1>diting the Properties of an
Image Sequence</font></b></li>
</ul>

<ul                   type=square>
<p>To view or edit the properties of an element, select the image, then
select: <b>E</b>dit =&gt; <b>P</b>roperties. The <b>Sequence Properties</b>
dialog will display details such as dimensions, position locking, looping,
and when the element's sequencing starts relative to other elements in
the Scene. </p>

<p>If you want an image element to remain in its current position while
running its animation sequence, and you do not intend to assign a motion
behavior for it, you should lock the element into place to make sure you
do not move it (even one pixel!) by accident. Select:<b> Position Locked
</b>(enabled). </p>

<p>If you want the animation sequence to cycle continuously, select: <b>Looping
</b>(enabled).</p>

<p>The &quot;<b>Starts</b>&quot; default setting is &quot;<i>When Scene
Starts</i>&quot; meaning the element's animation sequence will run when
the Scene opens (and continuously thereon if set to loop), and when you
click on the Play toolbar buttons. This setting makes the selected element
run independent of any other elements in the Scene.</p>

<p>Other &quot;<b>Starts</b>&quot; settings: &quot;<i>When Prior Starts</i>&quot;
and &quot;<i>When Prior Ends</i>&quot;. It is important to note that the
order in which you add elements to the Scene dictates their order<i> relative
to each other</i>, and these settings reflect that. For example, if you
add two image elements to the Scene and want them to run their animation
sequences consecutively (rather than simultaneously), for the <i>second
</i>element you must assign, &quot;<i>When Prior Ends</i>&quot;. </p>

<p>Note that when you assign the property &quot;<i>When Prior Ends</i>&quot;,
the image element will disappear from the Scene until the Scene is played
and the first element has completed its animation sequence.</p>

<li><b><font SIZE=+1>Motion Behavior - Drawing a Path for an Image Sequence</font></b></li>

<p>For each image element in the Scene, <b>Liquid Motion</b>allows you to add
and edit a <b>Drawn Path</b><i> </i><b>motion behavior</b>.<b> </b>When
you play the Scene, the element will run its animation sequence while it
follows your freeform path. You can edit the Drawn Path and customize the
motion behavior to pace the animation sequence over the course of the path.
</p>

<p>In the professional version of the program, <b>Liquid Motion Pro</b>, you can
produce even more exciting effects with a variety of other motion behaviors
such as making the sequence <i>wander</i>, <i>bounce</i> or <i>pinball
</i>around the Scene. You can even add a <i>Pinball Interactive </i>motion
behavior which makes the sequence respond to mouse movement within the
Scene, for example, chasing the mouse-cursor or running from it. And <b>Liquid Motion 
Pro</b>supports splining which provides more flexible editing capabilities.</p>

<h4>Adding a Motion Path Behavior to an Image Sequence</h4>

<ul                   type=square>
<p>To add a drawnpath motion behavior, highlight the image, then select:
<b>B</b>ehavior =&gt; Add <b>M</b>otion Behavior =&gt; Drawnpath. The <b>Edit
New</b> <b>Drawn Path</b> <b>Behavior </b>dialog will appear with instructions
and setting options. This dialog must remain open in order to create and
edit the motion path, so simply move it out of the way of your drawing
area of the Scene.</p>

<p>When an image element is selected, it appears in a highlighted box;
the Drawn Path motion is relative to the<i> upper left corner</i> of that
box. Say you want the image to appear as if walking along the Drawn Path,
meaning the &quot;feet&quot; of the image would trace the path. You can
draw the path proportionally higher in the Scene to reflect where you want
the bottom of the image to appear, or you can draw the path and later edit
the position of the path by moving the image element. </p>

<p><b><i>To draw a path in the Scene</i></b>: Click-and-drag with the <b>left
</b>mouse button. (To erase points in the drawnpath: click-and-drag with
the <b>right </b>mouse button.)</p>

<dl                   type=square>
<ul               type=circle>
<p><b>Tips!</b>: The speed in which you move the mouse when drawing the
path determines the number of points in the path (e.g., faster = fewer
points), and thus, how fast or slow the sequence will cover the path. (You
can, however, edit the pacing of the motion behavior.)</p>

<p>Also, the length of the Drawn Path relates to the length of the animation
sequence. For example, if the path is short or has relatively few points,
but the animation sequence is long, the image element will follow the Drawn
Path in as many cycles as it takes to complete its animation sequence.
(You can later adjust for this by reducing the pacing of the motion behavior.)</p>

<p>To make it easier to erase points on the path, you can reset the <b>Eraser
Size</b> (in pixels) in the Drawn Path Behavior<b> </b>dialog. This enlarges
the eraser so that it covers more area on the screen when you use the right
mouse button.</p>
</ul>
</dl>

<p>As you draw in the Scene, the path will appear highlighted and blinking.
Once you have completed drawing, click on the <b>Drawn Path Behavior </b>dialog
to activate it, then set the <i>Duration</i> (in seconds) or <i>Pacing
</i>(in points per second) for the motion behavior. This can later be edited,
but it is best to enter an initial setting before committing the motion
behavior to the Scene. To save the Drawn Path and all settings, click on
<b>OK</b>. You can then play the Scene. If you want to play the Scene as
it would appear in a web browser, click on the background border to deselect
all elements in the Scene, then click on the Play toolbar buttons. You
can also play the Scene with an image element and its Drawn Path highlighted
to see exactly how the image follows the path. This is helpful in determining
how to edit the Drawn Path if necessary.</p>
</ul>

<h4>Editing the Drawn Path</h4>

<ul                   type=square>
<p>Once you have saved the Drawn Path, you can edit its position by moving
the image element in the Scene. Do <i>not </i>do this when the <b>Drawn
Path Behavior </b>dialog is open and the highlighted path is on-screen,
otherwise your mouse action to move the element will actually add to the
Drawn Path. You must close the dialog, then select the image element and
move it to the desired position. Note that the <i>entire path </i>will
move to reflect the new position (not just that one segment of the path
where you moved the element). You can view the new path position by reopening
the Drawn Path Behavior dialog which will make the highlighted path appear
on-screen. </p>

<p>You can add or erase points on either <i>end </i>of the Drawn Path,
but you cannot do so <i>within </i>the path. If you want to edit the path,
say, in the middle, you must erase all points in the path up to that point
and redraw the remainder of the path. (<b>Liquid Motion Pro</b> allows you to edit
this with greater flexibility.)</p>
</ul>

<h4>Editing the Motion Behavior</h4>

<ul                   type=square>
<p>You may want to make adjustments to the <i>duration </i>or <i>pacing</i>
of the animation sequence so that portions of it match up with certain
points on the Drawn Path. In the <b>Drawn Path</b> <b>Behavior </b>dialog,
the <b>Pacing</b> setting allows you to designate a timing of points per
second for the motion behavior. For example, if the path contains 20 points
and the pacing is 5 points per second, the sequence should take 4 seconds
to complete the Drawn Path motion. However, it is important to note that
if the duration of the element's animation sequence is only 15 seconds,
the timing will still be off, so you may want to slow down the pacing of
the motion behavior. </p>

<p>You could also adjust this offset by setting a &quot;forced duration&quot;
for the image element's sequence to accomodate the pacing you have set
for the motion behavior. To set a forced duration for the image element,
select: <b>E</b>dit =&gt; <b>P</b>roperties. In the <b>Sequence Properties</b>
dialog, in the <b>Forced Duration</b> field, enter the appropriate setting.</p>
</ul>

<h4><b>Other Motion Behavior Options</b></h4>

<ul                   type=square>
<p>You will note the <b>M</b>otion Behaviors menu contains a number of
disabled options including: <b>G</b>ravity, <b>J</b>ump, <b>P</b>inball,
S<b>h</b>apes, <b>S</b>pline, and <b>W</b>ander. These features are provided
in the professional version of the program, <b>Liquid Motion Pro</b>, and provide
exciting flexibility to the motion behaviors you can apply to image elements
in the Scene or to Scenes nested within other Scenes. </p>
</ul>

<li><b><font SIZE=+1>Time Behavior - Adding a Scaled Time Factor to a Sequence</font></b></li>
</ul>

<ul                 type=square>
<p><b>Liquid Motion </b>also allows you to assign a time behavior to an image element.
(In an upcoming beta version, you will also be able to apply the time behavior
to the entire Scene.) Adding a time behavior allows you to adjust the <i>final
pacing</i> of a sequence, particularly when a motion behavior has also
been applied. In fact, it is highly recommended you add a motion behavior
<i>first </i>and adjust the pacing and duration therein. If you then want
to further speed up the entire sequence with a <b>Scaled Time</b> factor,
you can add that setting as a time behavior. The time behavior preserves
the relationship of each frame along the animation timeline, it just speeds
up the timeline. For example, you can enter a Scaled Time factor of 2.0,
the sequence will appear as if running twice as fast as normal.</p>

<p>Another useful trick of <b>Liquid Motion</b>'s Scaled Time time behavior feature
is making the animation sequence run backwards. The element's <b>Sequence
Properties </b>dialog will not allow you to enter a <i>negative</i> frame
rate. However, you can add a time behavior with a negative scaled time
factor (e.g., -1) which will force the sequence to run in reverse.</p>

<p>Generally, for a simple animation sequence with no motion behavior applied,
it is best to adjust the speed by increasing the image element's <i>frame
rate</i> in the Sequence Properties dialog, rather than adding a time behavior.</p>

<p><b><i>To add a time behavior to an image element</i></b>: highlight
the image, then select: <b>B</b>ehavior =&gt; Add <b>T</b>ime Behavior
=&gt; Scaled Time. The <b>Scaled Time Behavior </b>dialog will appear in
which you can enter the time factor. </p>

<li><b><font SIZE=+1>Deleting Motion or Time Behaviors</font></b></li>

<p>You can delete a motion or time behavior for a selected image sequence
by simply highlighting the image element, then select: <b>B</b>ehavior
=&gt; <b>D</b>elete =&gt; <b>T</b>ime Behavior (or) <b>M</b>otion Behavior.</p>
</ul>

<h1><b><font SIZE=+3>S</font><font SIZE=+2>aving a Scene</font></b></h1>

<p>You can save the Scene to a file which can later be edited and/or embedded
as an applet into a web page. Select: <b>F</b>ile =&gt; <b>S</b>ave (or
Save <b>A</b>s). The<b> Save</b> <b>Scene As </b>dialog allows you to designate
the filename and source directory. For Scene filenames, <b>Liquid Motion</b>provides
the suggested file extension .<b><i>jck</i></b>, though <b>Liquid Motion</b>will
not automically assign the extension for you, nor do you have to use that
extension. </p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, if you designate the directory for the Scene file
<i>before </i>adding sequences to the Scene, upon adding the first sequence,
<b>Liquid Motion</b> will automatically create the subdirectories: \<b>images</b>
and <b>\audio</b> and will copy each added sequence file (image or sound)
to the appropriate &quot;project directory&quot;. </p>

<p>Like any other program, you can later edit the Scene and save it with
the same name, or under a new name using <b>F</b>ile =&gt; Sa<b>v</b>e
As. Note that if you save to a different directory, Liquid Motion will not </p>

<h1><b><font SIZE=+3>E</font><font SIZE=+2>xporting a Scene as HTML</font></b></h1>

<p>The <b>F</b>ile menu provides an option, <b>Export HTML</b>, which
will generate an html file with the newly created animation Scene file
which can be viewed in a Java-enabled browser (e.g., Netscape 2.0). You
must first save the Scene file, then you can access the <b>E</b>xport HTML
feature. You can then associate the Scene file with your browser, then
simply double-click on the html file to open the browser and load the Scene.</p>

<h1><b><font SIZE=+3>P</font><font SIZE=+2>ublishing a Scene in a Web Browser</font></b></h1>

<p>To publish your animation Scene, you must move the <b>html file</b>,
the <b>.jck file</b>, the <b>classes</b> subdirectory, and the <b>image
</b>and<b> audio</b> <b>subdirectories </b>to your http tree.</p>

</body>
</html>
