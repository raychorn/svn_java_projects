<h2>Installation </h2>

<p>There is no installer for this release. To install Express copy the
files to a folder. </p>

<p>To setup JPad you will need to tell JPad where your Java directory is
located. To do this open JPad and choose the Java Directory item from the
Java menu and set the location of your Java directory. You will also need
to tell Java where your Java package sources are located. You can do this
by choosing the Package Directories item from the Java menu. For all the
Java tools to work, one of the entries in the Package Directories must
be &quot;...\java\lib\classes.zip&quot;. JPad assumes that your Java directory
in located your JPad directory and that the Java tools are located in &quot;...\java\bin\&quot;..</p>

<h2>Change History </h2>

<h3>JPad 1.0.5 (MWJ105.zip) </h3>
