<H1>Control The Nuclear Power Plant (Demonstration)</H1>
by <b>Henrik Eriksson</b>
<p>
The control-room operators of the Kärnobyl nuclear power plant are
telecommuting and are running the plant through the Web. However, the
mean time between failure for the components of Kärnobyl is not
great. Try to keep the reactor stable when component failures occur!

Use sequence buttons 1-3 to run a failure-simulation sequence. The
randomize button starts a random failure sequence. When a simulation
sequence is running, you can control the state of valves and pumps by
clicking on them. The moderator rods in the reactor can be moved by
mouse dragging them.
