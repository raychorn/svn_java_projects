This applet will eventually (when POST-Method URLs are working properly under Java) graph stock prices in real-time.
It allows the user to set the ceiling and the floor of a stock and be notified if either one of them is reached. For now, stock prices are simulated. Please let me know if you have any suggestions - <a href="mailto:dreke@virginia.edu">dreke@virginia.edu</a>!!!
<br><br>
The applet runs under Netscape 2.0b2 (SunOS, Solaris) and the JDK-appletviewer. Due to the pre-beta Java status of Netscape 2.0b, you will encounter problems running the applet on other platforms. For example, Windows 95 and Windows NT versions of Netscape2.0b do not properly implement scrollbar behavior (!yet).  <br>
Click on the title picture and the trace buttons to start the applet.
