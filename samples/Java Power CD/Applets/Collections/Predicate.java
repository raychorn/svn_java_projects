/**
 *
 *
 * Predicate is an interface for any class supporting a
 * predicate(Object obj) method that returns true or false
 * depending on whether obj obeys the maintained predicate.
 * <P>
 * When used as an element screener, check should 
 * return false if the
 * element should not be allowed in the collection, in which case
 * any attempted add or replace operation will raise an exception. Use of
 * screened collections is a simple way to dynamically ensure
 * that all elements have some desired property.
