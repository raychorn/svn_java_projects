 * ElementSorted is a mixin interface for Collections that
 * are always in sorted order with respect to a Comparator
 * held by the Collection.
 * <P>
 * ElementSorted Collections guarantee that enumerations
 * appear in sorted order;  that is if a and b are two Elements
 * obtained in succession from elements().nextElement(), that 
 * <PRE>
 * elementComparator().compare(a, b) <= 0.
