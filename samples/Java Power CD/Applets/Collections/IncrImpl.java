/**
 *
 *
 * Base class for  Immutable Collection implementations.
 * using `negative deltas'. That is, they update
 * an internally held Collection and set it as the internal Collection
 * for the Immutable Collection serving as the result, but also keep
 * a record of how to undo this change on a copy of the update, so
 * as to reconstruct the original Collection.
 * <P>
 * Since it's usually the case that applications use updates
 * rather than their sources, negative deltas are generally
 * more efficient than other schemes. Also, because updates don't
 * point to their sources, when a source becomes unreferenced,
 * it and all of its edit records can be garbage collected.
 * The price you pay for these nice aspects is that
 * reconstruction of old versions is not always all that fast or cheap.
 * <P>
 * The logic of reconstruction is to work our way to the UpdatableCollection
 * serving as the source of the edits, and then apply each undo operation
 * all the way back up to where we are. Subclasses specialize
 * on the exact edit operation to do at each step. 
 * <P>
 * Reconstruction would be two-line recursive procedure of the form:
 * <PRE>
 * UpdatableCollection reconstruct() {
 *   if (the lastest version) return a clone of the held UpdatableCollection
 *   else return edit(nextVersion.reconstruct())
 * }
 * </PRE>
 * Except for two problems:
 *
 * <OL>
 * <LI> We need to prevent interference among concurrent reconstructions
 *    and/or with operations on the collections themselves.
 *    But we cannot afford to hold a lock (synch) on every single node in
 *    the chain of edits at once. For long edit chains, it would 
 *    require too many
 *    simultaneous locks. The java runtime could even run out of them.
 *
 * <LI> The recursion could get very deep, which is not a good idea
 *    in java because of how it uses the stack.
 * </OL>
 * <P>
 * These problems are addressed by:
 * <OL>  
 * <LI> Using a condition variable, that causes each node to
 *    lock without holding all of the locks at once. The
 *    variable used, prevVersion_ happens to be the same
 *    one used for...
 *
 * <LI> Putting next-links from each node to the one representing
 *     the edit which is to follow. This way we can iterate rather
 *     than use recursion. 
 * </OL>
 * <P>
 * (All this would be a little prettier if we offloaded work
 * into Edit Command objects. But since these operations must be
 * coordinated with the Collection nodes, it works better to
 * roll them together.)
 * <P>
 * The code is highly particularized for the operations
 * currently supported in the collections package. It would
 * not be very easy to add subclasses beyond those for the four
 * basic flavors of collection subclasses currently implemented.
 *<P>
 * Some of the basic ideas for this class are due to Mark Miller
 * and unknown people at Xerox Parc.
