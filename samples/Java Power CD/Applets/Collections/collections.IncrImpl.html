Base class for  Immutable Collection implementations.
using `negative deltas'. That is, they update
an internally held Collection and set it as the internal Collection
for the Immutable Collection serving as the result, but also keep
a record of how to undo this change on a copy of the update, so
as to reconstruct the original Collection.
<P>
Since it's usually the case that applications use updates
rather than their sources, negative deltas are generally
more efficient than other schemes. Also, because updates don't
point to their sources, when a source becomes unreferenced,
it and all of its edit records can be garbage collected.
The price you pay for these nice aspects is that
reconstruction of old versions is not always all that fast or cheap.
<P>
The logic of reconstruction is to work our way to the UpdatableCollection
serving as the source of the edits, and then apply each undo operation
all the way back up to where we are. Subclasses specialize
on the exact edit operation to do at each step. 
<P>
Reconstruction would be two-line recursive procedure of the form:
<PRE>
UpdatableCollection reconstruct() {
  if (the lastest version) return a clone of the held UpdatableCollection
  else return edit(nextVersion.reconstruct())
}
</PRE>
Except for two problems:
<OL>
<LI> We need to prevent interference among concurrent reconstructions
   and/or with operations on the collections themselves.
   But we cannot afford to hold a lock (synch) on every single node in
   the chain of edits at once. For long edit chains, it would 
   require too many
   simultaneous locks. The java runtime could even run out of them.
<LI> The recursion could get very deep, which is not a good idea
   in java because of how it uses the stack.
</OL>
<P>
These problems are addressed by:
<OL>  
<LI> Using a condition variable, that causes each node to
   lock without holding all of the locks at once. The
   variable used, prevVersion_ happens to be the same
   one used for...
<LI> Putting next-links from each node to the one representing
    the edit which is to follow. This way we can iterate rather
    than use recursion. 
</OL>
<P>
(All this would be a little prettier if we offloaded work
into Edit Command objects. But since these operations must be
coordinated with the Collection nodes, it works better to
roll them together.)
<P>
The code is highly particularized for the operations
currently supported in the collections package. It would
not be very easy to add subclasses beyond those for the four
basic flavors of collection subclasses currently implemented.
<P>
Some of the basic ideas for this class are due to Mark Miller
and unknown people at Xerox Parc.
