/**
 *
 * CollectionEnumeration extends the standard java.util.Enumeration
 * interface with two additional methods.
 * @author Doug Lea
 * @version 0.93
 *
 * <P> For an introduction to this package see <A HREF="index.html"> Overview </A>.
 *
**/

public interface CollectionEnumeration extends Enumeration {

/**
 * Return true if the collection that constructed this enumeration
 * has been detectably modified since construction of this enumeration.
 * Ability and precision of detection of this condition can vary
 * across collection class implementations.
 * hasMoreElements() is false whenever corrupted is true.
 *
 * @return true if detectably corrupted.
**/

  public boolean corrupted();

/**
 * Return the number of elements in the enumeration that have
 * not yet been traversed. When corrupted() is true, this 
 * number may (or may not) be greater than zero even if hasMoreElements() 
 * is false. Exception recovery mechanics may be able to
 * use this as an indication that recovery of some sort is
 * warranted. However, it is not necessarily a foolproof indication.
 * <P>
 * You can also use it to pack enumerations into arrays. For example:
 * <PRE>
 * Object arr[] = new Object[e.numberOfRemainingElement()]
 * int i = 0;
 * while (e.hasMoreElements()) arr[i++] = e.nextElement();
 * </PRE>
 * <P>
 * For the converse case, 
 * @see ArrayEnumeration
 * @return the number of untraversed elements
