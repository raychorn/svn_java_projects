/**
 *
 *
 * Sortable is a mixin interface for UpdatableCollections
 * supporting a sort method that accepts
 * a user-supplied Comparator with a compare method that
 * accepts any two Objects and returns -1/0/+1 depending on whether
 * the first is less than, equal to, or greater than the second.
 * <P>
 * After sorting, but in the absence of other mutative operations,
 * Sortable Collections guarantee that enumerations
 * appear in sorted order;  that is if a and b are two elements
 * obtained in succession from nextElement(), that 
 * <PRE>
 * comparator().compare(a, b) <= 0.
 * </PRE>
 * @author Doug Lea
 * @version 0.93
