NAME
     pla - Format for physical description of Programmable  Logic
     Arrays.

SYNOPSIS
     pla

DESCRIPTION
     This format is used by programs  which  manipulate  plas  to
     describe  the physical implementation.  Lines beginning with
     a `#' are comments and are ignored.  Lines beginning with  a
     `.'  contain  control information about the pla.  Currently,
     the control information is given in the following order:
          .i  <number of inputs>
          .o  <number of outputs>
          .p  <number of product terms (pterms)>
          and optionally,
          .na<name> (the name to be used for the pla)

     What follows then is a description of the AND and OR  planes
     of  the  pla with one line per product term.  Connections in
     the AND plane are represented with a `1' for  connection  to
     the  non-inverted input line and a `0' for connection to the
     inverted input line.  No connection  to  an  input  line  is
     indicated  with  'x',  'X', or '-' with '-' being preferred.
     Connections in the OR plane are indicated by a '1'  with  no
     connection  being  indicated with 'x', 'X', '0', or '-' with
     '-' being preferred.  Spaces or tabs may be used freely  and
     are ignored.

     The end of the pla description is indicated with:
          .e

     Programs capable of handling split and folded arrays  employ
     the following format:


          AND PLANE

               Column (1) Contact to input  (2) No contact to input

               (1)     (2)
                1       -     Normal contacts, no splits or folds
                !       _          Split below
                ;       ,          Fold to right
                :       .          Split below and fold to right

          OR PLANE

               Column (1) Contact to output  (2) No contact to output

               (1)     (2)

                i       =     Split below
                |       '          Fold to right
                j       "          Split below and fold to right

                +        Output buffer
                D        Depletion load associated with product term
                N        No depletion load associated with product term


     Note  that  the  decoding  function  of  the  AND  plane  is
     separated  from the specification of its connectivity.  This
     makes the AND and OR plane specifications identical.

     These  programs  handle  the  following  more  general   set
     of .parameters:

          .il  <number of left-AND plane inputs>
          .ir  <number of right-AND plane inputs>
          .ol  <number of left-OR plane inputs>
          .or  <number of right-OR plane inputs>
          .p  <number of product terms>

          .ilt  <labels left-top-AND plane>
          .ilb  <labels left-bottom-AND plane>
          .irt  <labels right-top-AND plane>
          .irb  <labels right-bottom-AND plane>
          .olb  <labels left-bottom-OR plane>
          .olt  <labels left-top-OR plane>
          .orb  <labels right-bottom-Or plane>
          .ort  <labels right-top-Or plane>
          .pl  <labels left product terms>
          .pr  <labels right product terms>

     The first group of parameters must precede the second group.
     If there is only one AND or OR plane it is assumed to be the
     left one and the companion .parameters may be  shortened  by
     dropping their (left,right) designation character.

     In order to better deal with  folded  and  split  PLAs,  the
     following .parameters are proposed:

          .ig  <input group>
          .og  <output group>
          .ins  <inputs excluded from splitting>
          .inf  <inputs excluded from folding>
          .ons  <outputs excluded from splitting>
          .onf  <outputs excluded from folding>

     In   order   to   build   finite   state    machines,    the
     following .parameters are proposed:

          .iltf  <left-top-AND feedback terms>
          .ilbf  <left-bottom-AND feedback terms>
          .irtf  <right-top-AND feedback terms>
          .irbf  <right-bottom-AND feedback terms>
          .oltf  <left-top-OR feedback terms>
          .olbf  <left-bottom-OR feedback terms>
          .ortf  <right-top-OR feedback terms>
          .orbf  <right-bottom-OR feedback terms>

          .ilr  <left re-ordered inputs>
          .irr  <right re-ordered inputs>
          .olrf  <left re-ordered outputs>
          .orrf  <right re-ordered outputs>

     The .XXXf parameters must occur  in  pairs,  with  the .oXXf
     line  first.   Input and output terms must occur on the same
     side (top, bottom) of the PLA.  Feedback terms must be given
     in ascending order.  The re-order .parameters simplify feed-
     back routing.
