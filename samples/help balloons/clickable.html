Shown above is an example usage of my ClickableImage class.  ClickableImage 
allows you to specify a GIF to display and designate rectangles on the image
that are 'hot'.  When the users's mouse passes over the hot rectangle, its
help message is displayed in a pop-up balloon.  If the user clicks their mouse
while in a hot rectangle, the browser will display a specified URL in the
browser's current frame.  
<BR><BR>
ClickableImageApplet uses  my ClickableImage class. ClickableImage
may appear in an application or an applet, but the URL link
is disabled in an application (for obvious reasons).  While the ClickableImage is managed by
a layout manager, its help balloons aren't.  The help balloons are positioned
absolutely within the image, so that they may pop-up exactly in the position
that the mouse was in when it entered the hot rectangle.
