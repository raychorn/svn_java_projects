<H2>Sending Mail</H2>
<P>The class
<A HREF=java/api/amm.mail.Mailer.html>Mailer</A> <EM>(<A
HREF=java/source/Mailer.java>source</A>)</EM> actually handles the
mechanics of connecting to an SMTP server to send e-mail.  It must
be given an object implementing
<A HREF=java/api/amm.mail.MailSource.html>MailSource</A> <EM>(<A
HREF=java/source/MailSource.java>source</A>)</EM> when created.
When run, Mailer creates the connection, then calls functions from
it's MailSource which provide necessary Strings: a host to connect
to, the addresses involved, and so on.  Mailer turns control over
to the MailSource to actually write the text of the message, and
then recovers in time to close the connection.  But the MailSource
has the last laugh, and can respond when the connection is closed
(by loading a "mail sent successfully" page, for example).</P>
<P>With these two classes, one can either implement a standard
e-mail program, or a system that processes forms and sends out the
result as e-mail.  Since the MailSource is in command for the body
of the message, it can provide it all from one TextArea, or combine
the information in any number of lists, switches, text fields, or
other controls to create the message.</P>
<P>An example of the first type of program is
<A HREF=java/source/BasicMail.java>BasicMail</A>, and an example of the
second is <A HREF=java/source/AIAASurvey.java>AIAASurvey</A>.</P>
<H2>Receiving Mail</H2>
<P>The class
<A HREF=java/api/amm.mail.POPHandler.html>POPHandler</A> <EM>(<A
HREF=java/source/POPHandler.java>source</A>)</EM> handles the mechanics of
connecting to a POP3 server to fetch your e-mail.  It must be given an
object implementing
<A HREF=java/api/amm.mail.MailSink.html>MailSink</A> <EM>(<A
HREF=java/source/MailSink.java>source</A>)</EM>when created.</P>
<P>POPHandler makes a connection, and then handles any pending requests,
checks for new requests, then closes.  You can tell it to get all mail,
get new mail, delete messages, etc.  The MailSink (you'll probably want
to implement it with <EM>synchronized</EM> methods) keeps track of the
pending requests.  If a new request comes in while the POPHandler is
talking to the server, it is just stuffed in the queue, and the POPHandler
handles it when it finishes what it's currently doing.</P>
<H2>AMMail</H2>
<P>I've written an e-mail program using these classes.  It's seriously
multithreaded - every time I turn around I need more threads.
One to run the main window, one to connect with the POP3 server, one to
handle the data from the POP3 server and stuff it in the main window,
others to handle sending mail, etc.  Anyway, if you're interested, you
can download <A HREF=java/AMMail.zip>AMMail.zip</A> (27k).  I can't
really give a demo here because an applet can't connect to a POP3 server
or SMTP server.  But feel free to take it out for a spin, and let me know
what you think.</P>
