If you were running Java, you would see a color display here!
</APPLET>
<BR>
Above, you see a spectrum of colors that Java is able to produce.  If you click
on a color in the spectrum, its red, green and blue components will display
in the fields at the bottom of the spectrum.
<BR>
<BR>
Java is able to produce full, 24-bit color images!  Netscape 2.0, 
unfortunately, dithers everything into 256 color images, so 
you won't be able to get the full effect of the 24-bit spectrum
without a browser that supports 24-bit images!
