Applet: StockTrace

Date: November 20, 1995


StockTrace is a beta Java applet that graphs stock prices.
It will in its final version use actual stock data. For now,
stock prices are simulated, until POST URL's work in 
Java. 

To run the latest stocktrace:

1) Put all files into a browser accessible directory.
2) Open the document StockTrace.html from Netscape2.0.
3) Enjoy.
