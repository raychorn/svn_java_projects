  public boolean     includes(Object element);
 
/**
 * Return an enumeration that may be used to traverse through
 * the elements in the collection. Standard usage, for some
 * collection c, and some operation `use(Object obj)':
 * <PRE>
 * for (Enumeration e = c.elements(); e.hasMoreElements(); )
 *   use(e.nextElement());
 * </PRE>
 * (The values of nextElement very often need to
 * be coerced to types that you know they are.)
 * <P>
 * All Collections return instances
 * of CollectionEnumeration, that can report the number of remaining
 * elements, and also perform consistency checks so that
 * for UpdatableCollections, element enumerations may become 
 * invalidated if the collection is modified during such a traversal
 * (which could in turn cause random effects on the collection.
 * TO prevent this,  CollectionEnumerations 
 * raise CorruptedEnumerationException on attempts to access
 * nextElements of altered Collections.)
 * Note: Since all collection implementations are synchronizable,
 * you may be able to guarantee that element traversals will not be
 * corrupted by using the java <CODE>synchronized</CODE> construct
 * around code blocks that do traversals. (Use with care though,
 * since such constructs can cause deadlock.)
 * <P>
 * Guarantees about the nature of the elements returned by  nextElement of the
 * returned Enumeration may vary accross sub-interfaces.
 * In all cases, the enumerations provided by elements() are guaranteed to
 * step through (via nextElement) ALL elements in the collection.
 * Unless guaranteed otherwise (for example in Seq), elements() enumerations
 * need not have any particular nextElement() ordering so long as they
 * allow traversal of all of the elements. So, for example, two successive
 * calls to element() may produce enumerations with the same
 * elements but different nextElement() orderings.
 * Again, sub-interfaces may provide stronger guarantees. In
 * particular, Seqs produce enumerations with nextElements in
 * index order, ElementSortedCollections enumerations are in ascending 
 * sorted order, and KeySortedCollections are in ascending order of keys.
 * @return an enumeration e such that
 * <PRE>
 *   e.numberOfRemainingElements() == size() &&
 *   foreach (v in e) includes(e) 
 * </PRE>

 * That is, whether other is of the same size, and has the same 
 * elements() properties.
 * This is a useful version of equality testing. But is not named
 * `equals' in part because it may not be the version you need.
 * <P>
 * The easiest way to decribe this operation is just to
 * explain how it is interpreted in standard sub-interfaces:
 * <UL>
 *  <LI> Seq and ElementSortedCollection: other.elements() has the 
 *        same order as this.elements().
 *  <LI> Bag: other.elements has the same occurrencesOf each element as this.
 *  <LI> Set: other.elements includes all elements of this
 *  <LI> Map: other includes all (key, element) pairs of this.
 *  <LI> KeySortedCollection: other includes all (key, element)
 *       pairs as this, and with keys enumerated in the same order as
 *       this.keys().

 * @return true if considered to have the same size and elements.
