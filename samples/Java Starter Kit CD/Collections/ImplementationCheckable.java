/**
 * Check the consistency of internal state, and raise exception if
 * not OK.
 * These should be `best-effort' checks. You cannot always locally
 * determine full consistency, but can usually approximate it,
 * and validate the most important representation invariants.
 * The most common kinds of checks are cache checks. For example,
 * A linked list that also maintains a separate record of the
 * number of items on the list should verify that the recorded
 * count matches the number of elements in the list.
 * <P>
 * This method should either return normally or throw:
 * @exception ImplementationError if check fails
