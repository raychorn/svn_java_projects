/**
 *
 * Immutable is a root interface of immutable classes; i.e.,
 * those with objects that may be looked at but not updated. 
 * By necessity in Java, all implementation classes supporting
 * interface Immutable must be <CODE>final</CODE> classes.
 * <P>
 * There are
 * no operations defined in this interface. This interface is used only
 * to provide a name for this `Purity' property.
 * @author Doug Lea
