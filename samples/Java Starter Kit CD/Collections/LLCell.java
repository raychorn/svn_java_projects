 *
 *
 * LLCells extend Cells with standard linkedlist next-fields,
 * and provide a standard operations on them.
 * <P>
 * LLCells are pure implementation tools. They perform
 * no argument checking, no result screening, and no synchronization.
 * They rely on user-level classes (see for example LinkedList) to do such things.
 * Still, the class is made `public' so that you can use them to
 * build other kinds of collections or whatever, not just the ones
 * currently supported.
 * @author Doug Lea
 * @version 0.93

 * <P> For an introduction to this package see <A HREF="index.html"> Overview </A>.
