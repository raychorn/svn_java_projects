/**
 *
 *
 * Keyed is an interface most useful in association with SortedCollections.
 * Any class implementing Keyed contains method key, that returns
 * an object serving as a sorting key for the rest of the object.
 * <P>
 * The DefaultComparator class checks to see if its arguments
 * are Keyed, and if so uses the keys as the basis for comparison.
 * @author Doug Lea
 * @version 0.93
