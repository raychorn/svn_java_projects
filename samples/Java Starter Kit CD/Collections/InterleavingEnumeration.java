/**
 *
 * InterleavingEnumerations allow you to combine the elements
 * of two different enumerations as if they were one enumeration
 * before they are seen by their `consumers'.
 * This sometimes allows you to avoid having to use a 
 * Collection object to temporarily combine two sets of Collection elements()
 * that need to be collected together for common processing.
 * <P>
 * The elements are revealed (via nextElement()) in a purely
 * interleaved fashion, alternating between the first and second
 * enumerations unless one of them has been exhausted, in which case
 * all remaining elements of the other are revealed until it too is
 * exhausted. 
 * <P>
 * InterleavingEnumerations work as wrappers around other Enumerations.
 * To build one, you need two existing Enumerations.
 * For example, if you want to process together the elements of
 * two Collections a and b, you could write something of the form:
 * <PRE>
 * Enumeration items = InterleavingEnumeration(a.elements(), b.elements());
 * while (items.hasMoreElements()) 
 *  doSomethingWith(items.nextElement());
 * </PRE>
