The object of the game is to destroy the incoming missiles
<i>before</i> they hit one of the 5 bases.  Point and click to destroy
missiles.  New bases are created every <b>5000</b> points.  Each level
increases the speed and amount of incoming missiles.  The game is over
when all the bases are destroyed.  Watch out for <font color=#FF00FF>Magenta</font>
missiles!  Click in the missile commando window to start a new game.
Good Luck!
