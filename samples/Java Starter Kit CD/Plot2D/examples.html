  <DT> <A HREF="g2d1.html">Example 1</A>
  <DD> A simple example of a static plot. The data is created by
       the applet and plotted using the Graph2D, DataSet and Axis classes.
  <DT> <A HREF="g2d2.html">Example 2</A>
  <DD> In this example the applet loads the data to be plotted from
       an hardwired URL. The data is stored in a file as two columns
       of numbers. Obviously the URL could have been passed as a perameter
       to the applet.
  <DT> <A HREF="g2d3.html">Example 3</A>
  <DD> This is a replot of Example 1 with added features. A legend for
       the data, and the ability to change to range of the plot.
  <DT> <A HREF="g2d4.html">Example 4</A>
  <DD> This is a replot of Example 2 with the added feature of changing
       the range of the plot by dragging the mouse. This example introduces
       the subclass G2Dint of Graph2D that adds eventhandling to the
       parent class.
  <DT> <A HREF="g2d5.html">Example 5</A>
  <DD> This example uses the same method as example 2 to load the
       data from a server via a URL. This time though the URL does
       not reference a static file but a CGI script. The script is passed
       2 parameters and the new data returned for plotting.
  <DT> <A HREF="g2d6.html">Example 6</A>
  <DD> This example runs a program on the server and plots the results. The
       user can pass parameters to the program modifying the results and
       choose which physical quantities to plot.
