;;; Commentary:

;; This module derives an editing mode from c++-mode.  The derived mode
;; is for editing Java code.  (In the first release of this mode there's
;; very little specialized code; mostly you get a new mode-hook variable
;; ('java-mode-hook) and a new name ("Java") for your emacs mode line.

;; To use java-mode, put this in your .emacs file:
;; (autoload 'java-mode "yourLispCodeDirectory/java-mode" "java mode" t nil)
;; (setq auto-mode-alist
;;       (append '(("\\.java$" . java-mode)) auto-mode-alist))

;;; Change Log:
;;    $Log: java-mode.el,v $
; Revision 1.2  1995/04/06  03:03:21  mchapman
; o (fix provided by Eric Mumpower, nocturne@mit.edu)
;   Original java-mode failed if c++-mode-hook not set.
; o Added java-indent-command for better indenting of Java methods.
;   Still needs lots of work.
