HotJava looks like alot of fun.  What's more, the language definition
for Java is a thing of beauty.  I can't wait for a Linux port, as it
would let me play around with Java at home.

Dunno how many of you use GNU emacs, but I just whanged up a couple of
elisp modules to support fontified editing of Java source code.  They
are attached.

(I apologize if this message is considered too lengthy or inappropriate
for this mailing list.)

The code is fresh and poorly documented.  Apologies for that, too.

java-mode.el is derived from the cplus-md which shipped with GNU emacs
19.28.  It changes very little from that module.

	o It adds a new mode map, java-mode-map.

	o It tries to support the indentation style of the Java code
	  shipped with the Alpha2 HotJava release, by defining
	  defun-prompt-regexp so you can jump to the beginning/end of
	  properly indented Java methods.

	o It includes a couple of functions for use with the GNU emacs
	  19.28 imenu module (which pops up a menu of methods defined
	  in the current module).  These are near the end of the
	  module.

java-f-lck.el extends font-lock support to Java source modules.  I've
tested only the gaudier fontification of Java source.  See the 
comments for hints as to how to plug it into your emacs installation.

Of course this stuff works only with ASCII-encoded Java source files,
not with Unicode.  Perhaps someone would like to create an extensible
text editor in Java to solve this problem :)


Everything is released under the terms of GPL version 2, which is also
attached.

Finally, *many* thanks to Sun and the Java/HotJava developers for
giving us access to their elegant work.
