<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Java AWT Classes</H1>
<P>As I've run across problems with the AWT, I've subclassed a lot to fix
things.  Here are a few good examples:</P>
<DL>
<DT><A HREF=java/source/Slider.java>Slider</A></DT>
<DD>This is a combination of a Scrollbar and TextField.  You can
change the value stored by moving the Scrollbar or typing in the
TextField.  It rejects key other than numbers (and arrows, del, etc.),
and won't let you exceed the min/max that you specify.  There's also
a constructor that lets you specify a label, that will be placed
above the rest.</DD>
<DT><A HREF=java/source/Popup.java>Popup</A></DT>
<DD>This is a popup Window.  It draws a bunch of menu options, and sends
a LIST_SELECT to the parent Frame when you pick one.  I had a
<EM>really</EM> hard time getting the thing to close when you just move
the mouse away, because Window doesn't care to receive most MOUSE_EXIT
events.  Sigh.  It'll be better once JDK1.1 arrives!  Note that this
class work fine under the appletviewer, but I haven't found a browser
yet that shows it in exactly the right place...</DD>
<DT><A HREF=java/source/FrameClose.java>FrameClose</A></DT>
<DD>I created this so a Frame would actually close when you issue the
WINDOW_DESTROY command - in my case, clicking the close window button under
Windows 95</DD>
<DT><A HREF=java/source/FrameTab.java>FrameTab</A></DT>
<DD>Implements <EM>TabParent</EM>.  I created this so you could press <CODE>Tab</CODE>
to move between Components in a window.  It allows you to specify a Tab
order position when you add a Component.</DD>
<DT><A HREF=java/source/AppletTab.java>AppletTab</A></DT>
<DD>Implements <EM>TabParent</EM>.  This lets you tab around in Applets.</DD>
<DT><A HREF=java/source/PanelTab.java>PanelTab</A></DT>
<DD>This lets you tab around in panels that you include in a
FrameTab or AppletTab (or other TabParent).</DD>
<DT><A HREF=java/source/PanelTabP.java>PanelTabP</A></DT>
<DD>Implements <EM>TabParent</EM>.  I found that I needed a Panel to
be a TabParent in order to have different pages of a CardLayout
maintain different Tab Orders.</DD>
<DT><A HREF=java/source/TabParent.java>TabParent</A></DT>
<DD>This is an interface for whatever class will actually keep track
of the Tab Order.  When you add a TabPanel, for instance, it doesn't
keep the records, it just passes the data on to the TabParent.  That
way you can alternate the tab order between Components in and out of
the Panel.</DD>
